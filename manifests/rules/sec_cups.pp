# @summary 
#    Ensure CUPS is not enabled (Scored)
#
# The Common Unix Print System (CUPS) provides the ability to print to both local and network printers. 
# A system running CUPS can also accept print jobs from remote systems and print them to local printers. 
# It also provides a web based remote administration capability.
#
# Rationale:
# If the system does not need to print jobs or accept print jobs from other systems, it is recommended 
# that CUPS be disabled to reduce the potential attack surface.
#
# @param enforce
#    Enforce the rule or just test and log
#
# @param message
#    Message to print into the log
#
# @param loglevel
#    The loglevel for the above message
#
# @example
#   class security_baseline::rules::sec_cups {
#       enforce => true,
#       message => 'Test',
#       loglevel => 'info'
#   }
#
